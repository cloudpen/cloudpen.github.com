So many people believe that, working with Linux is cool. But also, a lot of people fret that download movie is not convenient, of course QQ.

Now, a new method can help us to slove the problem. We can search movies in Baidu Net Disk using WWW.BAIDU.COM . You will find,almost all of the film can be found in Baidu Net Disk.Then, put them on to your own account and download it!

If you feel the browser download file too slow, you can use the downloading tools. Such as Wget,axel.Wget is single process to download, but axel is multi process tool. So axel more quickly.

So, there is a more reason to use Linux. Forget Qvod, Forget Thunder!
